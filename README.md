# Who am I?

I'm a self taught embedded/systems/backend developer who lives in Michigan. I am planning on going to college after high school. As of the time I'm writing this I'm in the home stretch of my senior year of high school.

I'm an avid Linux user, and entheusiast. I use arch *(btw)*, but I plan on switching to Gentoo/Funtoo soon.

No I do not do code poetry (in case you didn't know; yes it exists), but I will have to try it sometime so I can live up to my name XD

## Stuff n' Things
Stuff n' things I've done/know stuff/things about

### Languages

I am fluent in C, and Java. And I am moderately experienced with Rust, Nim, and Lua. And I am working on my Lisp, x86/x86_64, and Forth.

As an experiment I was working on a very simple compiler written in C that would compile forth to NASM assembly, but it isn't finished. However with the minimal features it had it did successfully produce runnable binaries.

### Technologies

I can set up and deploy docker/podman containers/scripts. But I don't really know my way around writing the build scripts.

I'd like to think that I am pretty good at GNUMake but it's so huge, I don't really know. But I have a pretty good ammount of experience with it.

Emacs is my favorite editor, however [Howl](https://howl.io/) is a close runner up. Howl lags behind due to poor documentation/support around the editor. Howl, by far, is much snappier than any other editor I have used.

I own a few domains, but I don't have too much on them yet because I don't enjoy web dev as much as other subjects, and school has kept me busy.

Many of my projects are probably going to move to [my site](https://git.solow.xyz). In the future I may set up mirrors on my [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/PoetryInCode), and [gihub](https://github.com/PoetryInCode)
