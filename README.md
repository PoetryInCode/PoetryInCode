# Who am I?

I'm a mostly self taught embedded/systems/backend developer who lives in Southern Michigan. I am attending, and working for Spring Arbor University.

No I do not do code poetry (in case you didn't know; yes it exists), but I will have to try it sometime so I can live up to my name

### Languages
* C
* Rust
* Java
* Python
* Node.js

Many of my projects are probably going to move to [my site](https://git.solow.xyz). In the future I may set up mirrors on my [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/PoetryInCode), and [gihub](https://github.com/PoetryInCode)
